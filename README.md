# üìÑ A Power App for Document Categorization and Archival using GPT and AI Builder

Unlock the full potential of document processing in your organization with our innovative solution, developed on the Power Platform. This tool is a game-changer, utilizing Power Apps and Power Automate to not just capture, but intelligently categorize and archive documents. By simply using your device's camera within Power Apps, you can capture any document. Then, with the magic of AI Builder, the text is extracted, and the document is categorized as either an "Inquiry" or "Quotation." These documents are not only categorized but also displayed within the app for easy access. The cherry on top? A seamless archiving process that saves these documents as HTML files in your SharePoint document library.
